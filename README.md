# shinygrowth

A quick, couple-hour project.

Today I measured an OD timeseries of some bacteria took 10 minutes to make some curves and figure out the doubling rate of my strain.

So, exhasperated by having to take 10 minutes to make some plots, I spent a few hours making a quicker, web version of my analysis.
